# Retail Starter Pack

The Retail starter pack is an open source example chatbot for ecommerce customer service. It can assist with operations like checking an order status, seeing if an item is in stock, and initiating a return. The assistant uses forms to collect information and queries a SQLite database for customer and order information.
